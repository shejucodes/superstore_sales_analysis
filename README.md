## 🔎 Analysis Highlights

### 📈 Overall Sales Trend
Sales show a consistent upward trend over the years, with noticeable seasonal fluctuations, indicating business growth and cyclical demand.

### 🏆 Top 10 Products by Sales
A small number of premium products contribute significantly to overall revenue, showing revenue concentration among key items.

### 📦 Most Selling Products by Quantity
High volume products are not always the highest revenue generators, highlighting pricing differences and margin variation.

### 🚚 Most Preferred Ship Mode
Standard Class dominates shipping preferences, suggesting customers prioritize cost efficiency over expedited delivery.

### 💰 Profit by Category
Technology generates the highest total profit, followed by Office Supplies, while Furniture contributes comparatively lower profitability.

### 📊 Profit by Sub-Category
Copiers and Phones show strong profitability, whereas certain sub-categories like Tables demonstrate negative margins and require pricing or cost strategy adjustments.

### 📉 Sales vs Profit Relationship
Higher sales do not always guarantee higher profit. Several high-revenue transactions result in low or negative profit due to discounting or cost inefficiencies.
